# MuPDF WebAssembly Library

## Downloading

If you got this project from a tarball release, you're all set.

If you want to use the latest and greatest version, you need to clone it
recursively in order to also download the mupdf library and its dependencies.

	git clone --recursive git://github.com/ArtifexSoftware/mupdf-wasm

## Building

The WebAssembly build has only been tested on Linux at the moment. If you use
any other platform, you are on your own.

In order to build this you will need to install the Emscripten SDK in
/opt/emsdk. If you install it elsewhere, you will need to edit the build.sh
script to point to the appropriate location.

From the mupdf-wasm project, you can run build.sh to build the WebAssembly
library. The results of the build are a mupdf-wasm.wasm binary and
mupdf-wasm.js script, placed in the "dist/" directory.

The mupdf-wasm.wasm binary is quite large, because it contains not only the
MuPDF library code, but also the 14 core PDF fonts, various CJK mapping
resources, and ICC profiles. In order to keep it as small as possible, it is
built with a minimal features set that does not include CJK fonts, EPUB
support, etc.

In src/mupdf.js is a module that provides a usable Javascript API on top of
this WASM binary. This library works both in "node" and in browsers.

## Using

The example script in viewer/mupdf-view.html shows how to use the MuPDF
WebAssembly Library to create a PDF viewer in the browser.

Another example script is src/mutool.js which re-implements many of the usual
mutool commands using this library.
